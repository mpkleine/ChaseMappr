# ChaseMappr
This program will receive ChaseMapper data via UDP from the RDZSonde devices, store the JSON data to a text file, deserialize the JSON data, display the data to the console, and send the balloon lat, lon, and altitude data out a serial port (USB). This is used to feed external devices like the Gordon Cooper High Altitude Balloon Pointing Device.
